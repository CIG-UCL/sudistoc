# **sudistoc** 

**sudistoc** is a tool for susceptibility distortion correction of EPI images using deep-learning. \
It can be used to produce unsupervised, image supervised or distortion field supervised models as well as any combination of the 3. \
The documentation is rather light for the moment but feel free to contact me.
